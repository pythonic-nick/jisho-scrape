# Scraping the API of jisho.org to make plain text-format flashcards

This is a repository of files and scripts that I've used to make flashcards for my own personal study from the Japanese-English dictionary website jisho.org.

This script can produce a .txt file containing the kanji, hiragana, and English definition of a word, all separated by tabs. In this way, the .txt files can then be imported into your flashcard program/app of choice (Anki, Cram, Flashcards Deluxe, etc.). In addition, the jisho.org API also uses tags, meaning the English definition can show the type of word it is, as well as other additional information.
